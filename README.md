# Plant-Disease-Detection
This project aims to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images using machine learning and deep learning techniques. By analyzing visual symptoms on leaves, the model helps farmers and researchers identify diseases early and take preventive measures to protect crops
# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting and classifying **plant diseases** from leaf images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model helps farmers and researchers identify diseases early and take preventive measures to improve crop yield and health.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- The system takes a **leaf image** as input.  
- Preprocesses it using OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Classifies it into **Healthy** or **Diseased** categories.  
- Provides accurate predictions with confidence scores.
